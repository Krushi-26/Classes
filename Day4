First, we use DDL and DML to create tables, apply constraints, and load data.
Once data is ready, we use DQL to read and analyze data.

To improve performance, we select only required columns instead of *. 
WHERE is used to filter rows based on conditions.

LIKE is used when we don’t know the exact value  % for pattern matching -start, end, contain

DISTINCT removes duplicate values

COUNT tells us how many records or unique values exist

ORDER BY sorts data (ASC / DESC)

LIMIT restricts the number of rows returned
